# uLisp
This is a fork of uLisp. Goal of this fork is to refactor the project to multiple accesible files and add support for Arduino-mk. 

Reasons for this fork:
* Arduino IDE is terrible and will hold back further development
* Structured project is a sane way to support multiple architectures
* Arduino-mk is pretty amazing

Currently will be only tested on ATmega1284P and ATmega328P. 

A version of the Lisp programming language for ATmega-based Arduino boards.
